    <p style="font-family: Georgia"> This Website serves as my MYP Personal Project. What you see is a website dedicated to Ismailism, A Sub-Sect of Shia
    Islam which is very unique and special in its theology, philosophy and practices, the religion has had an immense Impact in the world, particularly the Islamic.
    Various Empires which have risen and fallen, Great ones, respected and admired by the World, who contributed to the 
    fields of Philosophy and Science, and wicked ones, hated universally by all throughout time and space for their
    despicable actions, adhered to this sect of Shia Islam. My Fascination with this subsect, which is (relatively, objectively
    the sect has tens of millions of adherents across the world) a small minority within the Islamic World, is thus not unprecedented.
    Admirers of this community, who's works are monumental to my own, such as Henry Corbin and W. Ivanow, have written extensively on the Ismaili religion, to the average person, however
    these works are unaccessable and almost unreadable, information is available on the internet, but in dense texts which one has to spend
    hours to completely understand. this website presents information differently, in a brief, easily digestable manner. and hence is my goal:
    to provide a access of quick and easy information for those who are interested in the religion, but simly don't have the time
    to invest into traditional sources of information, such as encyclopaedias and books.</p>
